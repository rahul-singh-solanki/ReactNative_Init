This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [\`@react-native-community/cli\`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Node Modules

First, you will need to install **Node Modules**.

To install the __node_modules__, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
yarn
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

Once you have installed \`node_modules\` you can run below command to build and run your app on your connected device or emulator.

### Android

```sh
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
